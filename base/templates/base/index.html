<h2>What is Unmodern Django?</h2>
<p>Unmodern is a rescue attempt to free Django from purgatory of JSON APIs.
    It is inspired by the philosophy of the
    <a href="https://unmodernweb.com/philosophy">Unmodern Web</a>. The idea
    is not to go back to the old ways, but to take full advantage of the
    power of the modern
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_platform">web as a platform</a>.
    This site aims to assist those who want to build cutting-edge user experiences
    using Django, without merely using it as a backend service for a bloated,
    overly complex frontend.

<h2>But DRF and Ninja Framework are great!</h2>
<p>They are great! But they are not the <em>only</em> ways to build an application
    with Django. At the same time, nobody wants to return to the days of full page
    reloads and janky form interactions. Check out some of the <a href="">Libraries</a>
    and <a href="">patterns</a> that make it possible!
