<h1>Simple Forms</h1>
<chip><a href="{% url 'base:libraries' %}#htmx">htmx</a></chip>
<p>When people think web applications, they think forms. Luckily Django includes
    nice abstractions to help with building and validating HTML forms.
    With a small sprinkle of htmx it's possible to create standard Django forms
    that do not require reloading the page or converting input to JSON.
</p>
<p>Try submitting the following form. See what happens when entering "Fred"
    in the name field.
</p>
{% include 'patterns/simple_forms/form.html' with form=form %}
<p>The SimpleForm itself is defined using
    <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/forms/">
    Django's form class</a>.
    Notice the validation on the "name" field.
</p>
<prism-remote
    src="https://github.com/Fingel/unmoderndjango/blob/main/patterns/views/simple_forms.py"
    lang="python"
    start=11
    end=19>
</prism-remote>
<p>To include this form on a page (such as this one) a template is defined to display it:</p>
<prism-remote
    src="https://github.com/Fingel/unmoderndjango/blob/main/patterns/templates/patterns/simple_forms/form.html"
    lang="markup"
></prism-remote>
<p>So far, this looks very similar to a normal Django workflow except for the
    <code>hx-post</code> and <code>hx-swap</code> attributes. The
    <code>hx-swap="outerHTML"</code> attribute will tell htmx to swap out the entire form
    for the response from the <code>patterns:simple-form</code> url when it is submitted. That url points to this view:
</p>
<prism-remote
    src="https://github.com/Fingel/unmoderndjango/blob/main/patterns/views/simple_forms.py"
    lang="python"
    start=22
    end=34>
</prism-remote>
<p>
    This is a very typical Django view for handling forms. If the request is a POST,
    the <code>SimpleForm</code> is instantiated using the request body. If it's
    valid, we return another template,
    <a href="https://github.com/Fingel/unmoderndjango/blob/main/patterns/templates/patterns/forms/form_submitted.html">form_submitted.html</a>.
    However, if the form is invalid, we simply return the main form template again
    with the invalid form passed in as context. This will display the invalid
    form to the user, marked up with error states and allow them to submit it again.
